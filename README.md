# Unity-Abrithi-Tweeters
'Abrithi Tweeters' is a 2D action game where a bird kills the monsters hiding in different obstacles like crates.\
This game has been developed with Unity and C# scripts. The arts have been downloaded from the open-source. I faced a lot of 'laptop shutdown due to overheating' challenges during unity game development.\
Currently I have made this game available on the Windows, Linux, and PC platforms. I tried to integrate it with Facebook and also tried to launch it on Android platform but failed due to laptop overheating. This game is able to be launched on any Operating System. \
The codes include basic Unity C# syntax to add force, operations on mouse down-up-drag, operations for the UI resolution, volume controller etc.\
This game is the result of a lot of trial and error and the useful suggestions from the Stack Overflow. \
You will be able to play this game from GamePlay/Abrithi Tweeters.exe\
Best of luck.
